# covid19-data-analyser

Especially in times of crisis and panic, with many different opinions on the topic, people should try to derive their own conclusion.
Luckily we live in a time, where the skills and tools to analyse data are open to everyone.
Thus this little project tries to provide you with the data and a small toolset
to understand, what the current state of the covid19 pandemic is right now.

This wil also be the basis for istcoronaexponentiell.de,
where this projects interactive dashboard will be hosted.
